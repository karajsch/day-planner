# day-planner

A straightforward scheduler with hour-long blocks of time between 9 am through 5pm. The current date and local time is displayed at the top. The 9-5 hour blocks are green if the block is upcoming, red if is that hour presently, and gray if the hour has already passed. Notes for each block can be added by clicking the appropriate block and then hitting the "Save" button to the left!
